Map Name: Sitemap_Gabii2
Author: Matthew Naglak

This interactive Leaflet map allows the reader to examine the spatial data
for a variet of stratigraphic units (SUs) situated across the site of Gabii
in order to gain a better understanding of the excavation as a whole.

It was built using Leaflet 1.5.1 with various plugins for extending features.

Plugin List
	Leaflet.PanControl to allow the reader to pan and zoom (https://github.com/kartena/Leaflet.Pancontrol)
	Leaflet-Ajax to import JSON files into the map (https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/leaflet-ajax).
	Leaflet-ruler to allow the reader to take basic measurements (https://github.com/gokertanrisever/leaflet-ruler).
	Leaflet-search to allow the reader to perform searches by SU number (https://github.com/stefanocudini/leaflet-search).

Other functionality includes the ability to click on a stratigraphic unit to gain more information.

Data for the map is located in a single GEOJSON file. This data was 
collected during the 2009-2019 field seasons in a regional projection 
(Monte Mario Rome Italy Zone 2) and transformed to WGS84 to import to Leaflet.
